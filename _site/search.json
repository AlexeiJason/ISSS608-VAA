    "text": "The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) did a deep dive into how 15-year-old students are doing in reading, math, and science. They didn’t just stop there – they also dug into students’ backgrounds, home situations, and school factors that could shake things up. PISA is like the gold standard when it comes to checking out how well students are really learning on a global scale. The results spill the beans on the quality and fairness of learning achievements worldwide, giving educators and policy folks the lowdown on what’s working in different countries.\nBut PISA isn’t just about the numbers; it’s about creating a common ground and getting people to team up and use that data. The whole idea is to get schools and policymakers to stop sizing themselves up against their own kind and start looking outwards. PISA wants them to peek at what teachers, schools, and policymakers are doing around the world and learn a thing or two.\nFast-forward to 2022, and PISA is still at it. They’ve got eight questionnaires floating around, getting the scoop from different education big shots – students, teachers, parents, and school principals. It’s like a global report card but with a whole lot more details."

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\nHow to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

    "text": "3 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

    "text": "4. Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n4.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2.

We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Finishing touch\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()"

In this section, you will learn how to create a scatterplot matrix by using the pairs function of R Graphics.\nBefore you continue to the next step, you should read the syntax description of pairsfunction.\n\nBuilding a basic correlation matrix\nFigure below shows the scatter plot matrix of Wine Quality Data. It is a 11 by 11 matrix.\n\npairs(wine[,1:11])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe required input of pairs() can be a matrix or data frame. The code chunk used to create the scatterplot matrix is relatively simple. It uses the default pairs function. Columns 2 to 12 of wine dataframe is used to build the scatterplot matrix. The variables are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing the lower corner\npairs function of R Graphics provided many customisation arguments. For example, it is a common practice to show either the upper half or lower half of the correlation matrix instead of both. This is because a correlation matrix is symmetric.\nTo show the lower half of the correlation matrix, the upper.panel argument will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], upper.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you can display the upper half of the correlation matrix by using the code chun below.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], lower.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluding with correlation coefficients\nTo show the correlation coefficient of each pair of variables instead of a scatter plot, panel.cor function will be used. This will also show higher correlations in a larger font.\nDon’t worry about the details for now-just type this code into your R session or script. Let’s have more fun way to display the correlation matrix.\n\npanel.cor &lt;- function(x, y, digits=2, prefix=\"\", cex.cor, ...) {\nusr &lt;- par(\"usr\")\non.exit(par(usr))\npar(usr = c(0, 1, 0, 1))\nr &lt;- abs(cor(x, y, use=\"complete.obs\"))\ntxt &lt;- format(c(r, 0.123456789), digits=digits)[1]\ntxt &lt;- paste(prefix, txt, sep=\"\")\nif(missing(cex.cor)) cex.cor &lt;- 0.8/strwidth(txt)\ntext(0.5, 0.5, txt, cex = cex.cor * (1 + r) / 2)\n}\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], \n      upper.panel = panel.cor)"

    "section": "Visualising Correlation Matrix using corrplot Package",
    "text": "Visualising Correlation Matrix using corrplot Package\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will focus on corrplot. However, you are encouraged to explore the other two packages too.\nBefore getting started, you are required to read An Introduction to corrplot Package in order to gain basic understanding of corrplot package.\n\nGetting started with corrplot\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\nWorking with visual geometrics\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to change the method argument to other supported visual geometrics.\n\n\nWorking with layout\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to experiment with other layout design argument such as tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset, cl.pos, cl.cex and cl.offset, just to mention a few of them.\n\n\nWorking with mixed layout\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to plot the corrgram are shown below.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\nCombining corrgram with the significant test\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReorder a corrgram\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReordering a correlation matrix using hclust\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

    "text": "Creating Interactive Heatmap\nheatmaply is an R package for building interactive cluster heatmap that can be shared online as a stand-alone HTML file. It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili.\nBefore we get started, you should review the Introduction to Heatmaply to have an overall understanding of the features and functions of Heatmaply package. You are also required to have the user manualof the package handy with you for reference purposes.\nIn this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using heatmaply to design an interactive cluster heatmap. We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\nWorking with heatmaply\n\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the basic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degree from the north.\n\n\n\nData trasformation\nWhen analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\nScaling method\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\n\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalising method\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentising method\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustering algorithm\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\nManual approach\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical approach\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriation\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with colour palettes\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe finishing touch\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

    "text": "Plotting Static Parallel Coordinates Plot\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package. Before getting started, it is a good practice to read the function description in detail.\n\nPlotting a simple parallel coordinates\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\nPlotting a parallel coordinates with boxplot\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. In this section, you will learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\n\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\nParallel coordinates with facet\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defect of the current design is that some of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n\n\nRotating x-axis text label\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using theme() function in ggplot2 as shown in the code chunk below\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nTo rotate x-axis text labels, we use axis.text.x as argument to theme() function. And we specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.\n\n\n\nAdjusting the rotated x-axis text label\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text(). We use axis.text.x as we want to change the look of x-axis text.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1))"

In this section, we will perform the following steps to manipulate and prepare a data.frtame that is appropriate for treemap visualisation:\n\ngroup transaction records by Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type and Type of Sale, and\ncompute Total Unit Sold, Total Area, Median Unit Price and Median Transacted Price by applying appropriate summary statistics on No. of Units, Area (sqm), Unit Price ($ psm) and Transacted Price ($) respectively.\n\nTwo key verbs of dplyr package, namely: group_by() and summarize() will be used to perform these steps.\ngroup_by() breaks down a data.frame into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nStudents who are new to dplyr methods should consult Introduction to dplyr before moving on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\nGrouped summaries without the Pipe\nThe code chank below shows a typical two lines code approach to perform the steps.\n\nrealis2018_grouped &lt;- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,\n                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, \n                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- summarise(realis2018_grouped, \n                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), \n                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nAggregation functions such as sum() and meadian() obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value.

    "section": "Designing Treemap with treemap Package",
    "text": "Designing Treemap with treemap Package\ntreemap package is a R package specially designed to offer great flexibility in drawing treemaps. The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\nDesigning a static treemap\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\nUsing the basic arguments\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\nWorking with vColor and type arguments\nIn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking to learn from the conde chunk above.\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\n\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\nColours in treemap package\nThere are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: mapping and palette. The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping. The “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color. The “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\nThe “value” type treemap\nThe code chunk below shows a value type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\nThe “manual” type treemap\nThe “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\nThe code chunk below shows a manual type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreemap Layout\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: “squarified” and “pivotSize”. The default is “pivotSize”.\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\n\n\nWorking with algorithm argument\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing sortID\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )"
