The package will be used to plot static ternary plots.\nPlotly R, an R package for creating interactive web-based graphs via plotly’s JavaScript graphing library, plotly.js . The plotly R libary contains the ggplotly function, which will convert ggplot2 figures into a Plotly object.\n\nWe will also need to ensure that selected tidyverse family packages namely: readr, dplyr and tidyr are also installed and loaded.\nIn this exercise, version 3.2.1 of ggplot2 will be installed instead of the latest version of ggplot2. This is because the current version of ggtern package is not compatible to the latest version of ggplot2.\nThe code chunks below will accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(plotly, ggtern, tidyverse)"

Drawing upon the principles of data visualization design covered in Lessons 1 and 2, I will draft a blueprint for an alternative design. Following this, I’ll utilize ggplot2, along with its extensions and the tidyverse packages, to revamp the original design, aiming to improve its visual impact and enhance clarity."

    "text": "Creating network objects using tidygraph\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a graph data model by using tidygraph package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\nBefore getting started, you are advised to read these two articles:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\ntidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope\n\n\nThe tbl_graph object\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\nThe dplyr verbs in tidygraph\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges.

Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\nFor example,\n\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\nVisit the reference guide of activate() to find out more about the function."

    "text": "Plotting Static Network Graphs with ggraph package\nggraph is an extension of ggplot2, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.\nAs in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a ggraph’s network graph, they are:\n\nnodes,\nedges and\nlayouts.\n\nFor a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.\n\nPlotting a basic network graph\nThe code chunk below uses ggraph(), geom-edge_link() and geom_node_point() to plot a network graph by using GAStech_graph. Before your get started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nThe basic plotting function is ggraph(), which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the default network graph theme\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes. Before your get started, it is advisable to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nggraph introduces a special ggplot theme that provides better defaults for network graphs than the normal ggplot defaults. theme_graph(), besides removing axes, grids, and border, changes the font to Arial Narrow (this can be overridden).\nThe ggraph theme can be set for a series of plots with the set_graph_style() command run before the graphs are plotted or by using theme_graph() in the individual plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the coloring of the plot\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with ggraph’s layouts\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by ggraph().\n\n\n\n\nFruchterman and Reingold layout\nThe code chunks below will be used to plot the network graph using Fruchterman and Reingold layout.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nlayout argument is used to define the layout to be used.\n\n\n\nModifying network nodes\nIn this section, you will colour each node by referring to their respective departments.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = 3))\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_node_point is equivalent in functionality to geo_point of ggplot2. It allows for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes. In the codes chnuks above colour and size are used.\n\n\n\nModifying edges\nIn the code chunk below, the thickness of the edges will be mapped with the Weight variable.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 3)\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_edge_link draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line."

    "text": "Plotting Static Parallel Coordinates Plot\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package. Before getting started, it is a good practice to read the function description in detail.\n\nPlotting a simple parallel coordinates\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\nPlotting a parallel coordinates with boxplot\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. In this section, you will learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\n\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\nParallel coordinates with facet\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defect of the current design is that some of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n\n\nRotating x-axis text label\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using theme() function in ggplot2 as shown in the code chunk below\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nTo rotate x-axis text labels, we use axis.text.x as argument to theme() function. And we specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.\n\n\n\nAdjusting the rotated x-axis text label\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text(). We use axis.text.x as we want to change the look of x-axis text.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1))"

However, you are encouraged to explore the other two packages too.\nBefore getting started, you are required to read An Introduction to corrplot Package in order to gain basic understanding of corrplot package.\n\nGetting started with corrplot\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\nWorking with visual geometrics\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to change the method argument to other supported visual geometrics.\n\n\nWorking with layout\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to experiment with other layout design argument such as tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset, cl.pos, cl.cex and cl.offset, just to mention a few of them.\n\n\nWorking with mixed layout\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to plot the corrgram are shown below.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\nCombining corrgram with the significant test\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReorder a corrgram\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReordering a correlation matrix using hclust\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

Indeed, the Happiness Score variable have relatively higher values, what makes that the other variables with small values all look the same. Thus, we need to normalize this matrix.

    "section": "Creating Interactive Heatmap",
    "text": "Creating Interactive Heatmap\nheatmaply is an R package for building interactive cluster heatmap that can be shared online as a stand-alone HTML file. It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili.\nBefore we get started, you should review the Introduction to Heatmaply to have an overall understanding of the features and functions of Heatmaply package. You are also required to have the user manualof the package handy with you for reference purposes.\nIn this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using heatmaply to design an interactive cluster heatmap. We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\nWorking with heatmaply\n\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the basic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degree from the north.\n\n\n\nData trasformation\nWhen analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\nScaling method\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\n\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalising method\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentising method\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustering algorithm\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\nManual approach\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical approach\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriation\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with colour palettes\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe finishing touch\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

    "text": "Data Wrangling\nIn this exercise, REALIS2018.csv data will be used. This dataset provides information of private property transaction records in 2018. The dataset is extracted from REALIS portal (https://spring.ura.gov.sg/lad/ore/login/index.cfm) of Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n\nImporting the data set\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr is used to import realis2018.csv into R and parsed it into tibble R data.frame format.\n\nrealis2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/realis2018.csv\")\n\nThe output tibble data.frame is called realis2018.\n\n\nData Wrangling and Manipulation\nThe data.frame realis2018 is in trasaction record form, which is highly disaggregated and not appropriate to be used to plot a treemap. In this section, we will perform the following steps to manipulate and prepare a data.frtame that is appropriate for treemap visualisation:\n\ngroup transaction records by Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type and Type of Sale, and\ncompute Total Unit Sold, Total Area, Median Unit Price and Median Transacted Price by applying appropriate summary statistics on No. of Units, Area (sqm), Unit Price ($ psm) and Transacted Price ($) respectively.\n\nTwo key verbs of dplyr package, namely: group_by() and summarize() will be used to perform these steps.\ngroup_by() breaks down a data.frame into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nStudents who are new to dplyr methods should consult Introduction to dplyr before moving on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\nGrouped summaries without the Pipe\nThe code chank below shows a typical two lines code approach to perform the steps.\n\nrealis2018_grouped &lt;- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,\n                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, \n                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- summarise(realis2018_grouped, \n                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), \n                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nAggregation functions such as sum() and meadian() obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. The argument na.rm = TRUE removes the missing values prior to computation.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk above is not very efficient because we have to give each intermediate data.frame a name, even though we don’t have to care about it.\n\n\nGrouped summaries with the pipe\nThe code chunk below shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %&gt;%:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nTo learn more about pipe, visit this excellent article: Pipes in R Tutorial For Beginners.\n\n\n\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- realis2018 %&gt;% \n  group_by(`Project Name`,`Planning Region`, \n           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`, \n           `Type of Sale`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE), \n            `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))"

    "section": "Designing Treemap with treemap Package",
    "text": "Designing Treemap with treemap Package\ntreemap package is a R package specially designed to offer great flexibility in drawing treemaps. The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\nDesigning a static treemap\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\nUsing the basic arguments\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\nWorking with vColor and type arguments\nIn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking to learn from the conde chunk above.\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\n\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\nColours in treemap package\nThere are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: mapping and palette. The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping. The “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color. The “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\nThe “value” type treemap\nThe code chunk below shows a value type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\nThe “manual” type treemap\nThe “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\nThe code chunk below shows a manual type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreemap Layout\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: “squarified” and “pivotSize”. The default is “pivotSize”.\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\n\n\nWorking with algorithm argument\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing sortID\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )"

The data table should include the variables PA, SZ, YOUNG, ECONOMY ACTIVE, AGED, TOTAL, DEPENDENCY.\n\nYOUNG: age group 0 to 4 until age groyup 20 to 24,\nECONOMY ACTIVE: age group 25-29 until age group 60-64,\nAGED: age group 65 and above,\nTOTAL: all age group, and\nDEPENDENCY: the ratio between young and aged against economy active group\n\n\nData wrangling\nThe following data wrangling and transformation functions will be used:\n\npivot_wider() of tidyr package, and\nmutate(), filter(), group_by() and select() of dplyr package\n\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata %&gt;%\n  filter(Time == 2020) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA, SZ, AG) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`POP` = sum(`Pop`)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from=AG, \n              values_from=POP) %&gt;%\n  mutate(YOUNG = rowSums(.[3:6])\n         +rowSums(.[12])) %&gt;%\nmutate(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` = rowSums(.[7:11])+\nrowSums(.[13:15]))%&gt;%\nmutate(`AGED`=rowSums(.[16:21])) %&gt;%\nmutate(`TOTAL`=rowSums(.[3:21])) %&gt;%  \nmutate(`DEPENDENCY` = (`YOUNG` + `AGED`)\n/`ECONOMY ACTIVE`) %&gt;%\n  select(`PA`, `SZ`, `YOUNG`, \n       `ECONOMY ACTIVE`, `AGED`, \n       `TOTAL`, `DEPENDENCY`)\n\n\n\nJoining the attribute data and geospatial data\nBefore we can perform the georelational join, one extra step is required to convert the values in PA and SZ fields to uppercase. This is because the values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase. On the other, hand the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase.\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata2020 %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(.vars = vars(PA, SZ), \n          .funs = funs(toupper)) %&gt;%\n  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` &gt; 0)\n\nNext, left_join() of dplyr is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. SUBZONE_N and SZ as the common identifier.\n\nmpsz_pop2020 &lt;- left_join(mpsz, popdata2020,\n                          by = c(\"SUBZONE_N\" = \"SZ\"))\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used with mpsz simple feature data frame as the left data table is to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame.\n\n\nwrite_rds(mpsz_pop2020, \"data/rds/mpszpop2020.rds\")"

    "text": "Choropleth Mapping Geospatial Data Using tmap\nTwo approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using tmap, they are:\n\nPlotting a thematic map quickly by using qtm().\nPlotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.\n\n\nPlotting a choropleth map quickly by using qtm()\nThe easiest and quickest to draw a choropleth map using tmap is using qtm(). It is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.\nThe code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\nqtm(mpsz_pop2020, \n    fill = \"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ntmap_mode() with “plot” option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, “view” option should be used.\nfill argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)\n\n\n\nCreating a choropleth map by using tmap’s elements\nDespite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantge of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap’s drawing elements should be used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"Dependency ratio\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sub-section, we will share with you tmap functions that used to plot these elements.\n\nDrawing a base map\nThe basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elemments such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().\nIn the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing a choropleth map using tm_polygons()\nTo draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from tm_polygons():\n\nThe default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called “pretty”. A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap will be provided in sub-section 4.3.\nThe default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer. You will learn more about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing value will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\nDrawing a choropleth map using tm_fill() and *tm_border()**\nActually, tm_polygons() is a wraper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shared according to the respective dependecy values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,  alpha = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-gray border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBeside alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is “solid”.\n\n\n\n\nData classification methods of tmap\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\nPlotting choropleth maps with built-in classification methods\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\nWarning: Maps Lie!\n\n\nDIY: Using what you had learned, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences.\n\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can you draw?\n\n\n\nPlotting choropleth map with custome break\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore we get started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.1111  0.7147  0.7866  0.8585  0.8763 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColour Scheme\ntmap supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\nUsing ColourBrewer palette\nTo change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to palette argument of tm_fill() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth map is shaded in green.\nTo reverse the colour shading, add a “-” prefix.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the colour scheme has been reversed.\n\n\n\nMap Layouts\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohensive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios. Colour settings and data classification methods covered in the previous section relate to the palette and break-points are used to affect how the map looks.\n\nMap Legend\nIn tmap, several legend options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"jenks\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \\n(Jenks classification)\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap style\ntmap allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed. They can be called by using tmap_style().\nThe code chunk below shows the classic style is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"classic\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCartographic Furniture\nBeside map style, tmap also also provides arguments to draw other map furniture such as compass, scale bar and grid lines.\nIn the code chunk below, tm_compass(), tm_scale_bar() and tm_grid() are used to add compass, scale bar and grid lines onto the choropleth map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"No. of persons\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio \\nby planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +\n  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reset the default style, refer to the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\nDrawing Small Multiple Choropleth Maps\nSmall multiple maps, also referred to as facet maps, are composed of many maps arrange side-by-side, and sometimes stacked vertically. Small multiple maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time.\nIn tmap, small multiple maps can be plotted in three ways:\n\nby assigning multiple values to at least one of the asthetic arguments,\nby defining a group-by variable in tm_facets(), and\nby creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\n\nBy assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by defining ncols in tm_fill()\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(c(\"YOUNG\", \"AGED\"),\n          style = \"equal\", \n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(c(\"DEPENDENCY\",\"AGED\"),\n          style = c(\"equal\", \"quantile\"), \n          palette = list(\"Blues\",\"Greens\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy defining a group-by variable in tm_facets()\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by using tm_facets().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          thres.poly = 0) + \n  tm_facets(by=\"REGION_N\", \n            free.coords=TRUE, \n            drop.shapes=FALSE) +\n  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,\n            title.position = c(\"center\", \"center\"), \n            title.size = 20) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange()\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\nyoungmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"YOUNG\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\nagedmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"AGED\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(youngmap, agedmap, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMappping Spatial Object Meeting a Selection Criterion\nInstead of creating small multiple choropleth map, you can also use selection funtion to map spatial objects meeting the selection criterion.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 5.0,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)"

    "section": "Extreme Value Maps",
    "text": "Extreme Value Maps\nExtreme value maps are variations of common choropleth maps where the classification is designed to highlight extreme values at the lower and upper end of the scale, with the goal of identifying outliers. These maps were developed in the spirit of spatializing EDA, i.e., adding spatial features to commonly used approaches in non-spatial EDA (Anselin 1994).\n\nPercentile Map\nThe percentile map is a special type of quantile map with six specific categories: 0-1%,1-10%, 10-50%,50-90%,90-99%, and 99-100%. The corresponding breakpoints can be derived by means of the base R quantile command, passing an explicit vector of cumulative probabilities as c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1). Note that the begin and endpoint need to be included.\n\nData Preparation\nStep 1: Exclude records with NA by using the code chunk below.\n\n\nNGA_wp &lt;- NGA_wp %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\n\nStep 2: Creating customised classification and extracting values\n\npercent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\nvar &lt;- NGA_wp[\"pct_functional\"] %&gt;%\n  st_set_geometry(NULL)\nquantile(var[,1], percent)\n\n       0%        1%       10%       50%       90%       99%      100% \n0.0000000 0.0000000 0.2169811 0.4791667 0.8611111 1.0000000 1.0000000 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen variables are extracted from an sf data.frame, the geometry is extracted as well. For mapping and spatial manipulation, this is the expected behavior, but many base R functions cannot deal with the geometry. Specifically, the quantile() gives an error. As a result st_set_geomtry(NULL) is used to drop geomtry field.\n\n\n\n\nWhy writing functions?\nWriting a function has three big advantages over using copy-and-paste:\n\nYou can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.\nAs requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.\nYou eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).\n\nSource: Chapter 19: Functions of R for Data Science.\n\n\nCreating the get.var function\nFirstly, we will write an R function as shown below to extract a variable (i.e. wp_nonfunctional) as a vector out of an sf data.frame.\n\narguments:\n\nvname: variable name (as character, in quotes)\ndf: name of sf data frame\n\nreturns:\n\nv: vector with values (without a column name)\n\n\n\nget.var &lt;- function(vname,df) {\n  v &lt;- df[vname] %&gt;% \n    st_set_geometry(NULL)\n  v &lt;- unname(v[,1])\n  return(v)\n}\n\n\n\nA percentile mapping function\nNext, we will write a percentile mapping function by using the code chunk below.\n\npercentmap &lt;- function(vnam, df, legtitle=NA, mtitle=\"Percentile Map\"){\n  percent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\n  var &lt;- get.var(vnam, df)\n  bperc &lt;- quantile(var, percent)\n  tm_shape(df) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(df) +\n     tm_fill(vnam,\n             title=legtitle,\n             breaks=bperc,\n             palette=\"Blues\",\n          labels=c(\"&lt; 1%\", \"1% - 10%\", \"10% - 50%\", \"50% - 90%\", \"90% - 99%\", \"&gt; 99%\"))  +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_layout(main.title = mtitle, \n            title.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"))\n}\n\n\n\nTest drive the percentile mapping function\nTo run the function, type the code chunk as shown below.\n\npercentmap(\"total_wp\", NGA_wp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is just a bare bones implementation. Additional arguments such as the title, legend positioning just to name a few of them, could be passed to customise various features of the map.\n\n\n\nBox map\nIn essence, a box map is an augmented quartile map, with an additional lower and upper category. When there are lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks is the minimum value, and the second break is the lower fence. In contrast, when there are no lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks will be the lower fence, and the second break is the minimum value (there will be no observations that fall in the interval between the lower fence and the minimum value).\n\nggplot(data = NGA_wp,\n       aes(x = \"\",\n           y = wp_nonfunctional)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying summary statistics on a choropleth map by using the basic principles of boxplot.\nTo create a box map, a custom breaks specification will be used. However, there is a complication. The break points for the box map vary depending on whether lower or upper outliers are present.\n\n\nCreating the boxbreaks function\nThe code chunk below is an R function that creating break points for a box map.\n\narguments:\n\nv: vector with observations\nmult: multiplier for IQR (default 1.5)\n\nreturns:\n\nbb: vector with 7 break points compute quartile and fences\n\n\n\nboxbreaks &lt;- function(v,mult=1.5) {\n  qv &lt;- unname(quantile(v))\n  iqr &lt;- qv[4] - qv[2]\n  upfence &lt;- qv[4] + mult * iqr\n  lofence &lt;- qv[2] - mult * iqr\n  # initialize break points vector\n  bb &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=7)\n  # logic for lower and upper fences\n  if (lofence &lt; qv[1]) {  # no lower outliers\n    bb[1] &lt;- lofence\n    bb[2] &lt;- floor(qv[1])\n  } else {\n    bb[2] &lt;- lofence\n    bb[1] &lt;- qv[1]\n  }\n  if (upfence &gt; qv[5]) { # no upper outliers\n    bb[7] &lt;- upfence\n    bb[6] &lt;- ceiling(qv[5])\n  } else {\n    bb[6] &lt;- upfence\n    bb[7] &lt;- qv[5]\n  }\n  bb[3:5] &lt;- qv[2:4]\n  return(bb)\n}\n\n\n\nCreating the get.var function\nThe code chunk below is an R function to extract a variable as a vector out of an sf data frame.\n\narguments:\n\nvname: variable name (as character, in quotes)\ndf: name of sf data frame\n\nreturns:\n\nv: vector with values (without a column name)\n\n\n\nget.var &lt;- function(vname,df) {\n  v &lt;- df[vname] %&gt;% st_set_geometry(NULL)\n  v &lt;- unname(v[,1])\n  return(v)\n}\n\n\n\nTest drive the newly created function\nLet’s test the newly created function\n\nvar &lt;- get.var(\"wp_nonfunctional\", NGA_wp) \nboxbreaks(var)\n\n[1] -56.5   0.0  14.0  34.0  61.0 131.5 278.0\n\n\n\n\nBoxmap function\nThe code chunk below is an R function to create a box map. - arguments: - vnam: variable name (as character, in quotes) - df: simple features polygon layer - legtitle: legend title - mtitle: map title - mult: multiplier for IQR - returns: - a tmap-element (plots a map)\n\nboxmap &lt;- function(vnam, df, \n                   legtitle=NA,\n                   mtitle=\"Box Map\",\n                   mult=1.5){\n  var &lt;- get.var(vnam,df)\n  bb &lt;- boxbreaks(var)\n  tm_shape(df) +\n    tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(df) +\n     tm_fill(vnam,title=legtitle,\n             breaks=bb,\n             palette=\"Blues\",\n          labels = c(\"lower outlier\", \n                     \"&lt; 25%\", \n                     \"25% - 50%\", \n                     \"50% - 75%\",\n                     \"&gt; 75%\", \n                     \"upper outlier\"))  +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_layout(main.title = mtitle, \n            title.position = c(\"left\",\n                               \"top\"))\n}\n\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\nboxmap(\"wp_nonfunctional\", NGA_wp)"

    "text": "Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW)\n\nThe method\nIn the IDW interpolation method, the sample points are weighted during interpolation such that the influence of one point relative to another declines with distance from the unknown point you want to create.\n\nWeighting is assigned to sample points through the use of a weighting coefficient that controls how the weighting influence will drop off as the distance from new point increases. The greater the weighting coefficient, the less the effect points will have if they are far from the unknown point during the interpolation process. As the coefficient increases, the value of the unknown point approaches the value of the nearest observational point.\nIt is important to notice that the IDW interpolation method also has some disadvantages: the quality of the interpolation result can decrease, if the distribution of sample data points is uneven. Furthermore, maximum and minimum values in the interpolated surface can only occur at sample data points. This often results in small peaks and pits around the sample data points.\n\n\nWorking with gstat\nWe are going to use three parameters of the gstat function:\n\nformula: The prediction “formula” specifying the dependent and the independent variables (covariates)\ndata: The calibration data\nmodel: The variogram model\n\nKeep in mind that we need to specify parameter names, because these three parameters are not the first three in the gstat function definition.\nFor example, to interpolate using the IDW method we create the following gstat object, specifying just the formula and data:\ng = gstat(formula = annual ~ 1, data = rainfall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn R, formula objects are used to specify relation between objects, in particular—the role of different data columns in statistical models. A formula object is created using the ~ operator, which separates names of dependent variables (to the left of the ~ symbol) and independent variables (to the right of the ~ symbol). Writing 1 to the right of the ~ symbol, as in ~ 1, means that there are no independent variables38.\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\nres &lt;- gstat(formula = MONTHSUM ~ 1, \n             locations = rfdata_sf, \n             nmax = 5,\n             set = list(idp = 0))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSpatial interpolation is not a rocket science, students should try to explore the method by changing nmax argument in order to understand how the final surface map will be affected by different nmax values.\n\n\nNow that our model is defined, we can use predict() to actually interpolate, i.e., to calculate predicted values.

    "section": "Kriging",
    "text": "Kriging\n\nThe method\nKriging is one of several methods that use a limited set of sampled data points to estimate the value of a variable over a continuous spatial field. An example of a value that varies across a random spatial field might be total monthly rainfall over Singapore. It differs from Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation discussed earlier in that it uses the spatial correlation between sampled points to interpolate the values in the spatial field: the interpolation is based on the spatial arrangement of the empirical observations, rather than on a presumed model of spatial distribution. Kriging also generates estimates of the uncertainty surrounding each interpolated value.\nIn a general sense, the kriging weights are calculated such that points nearby to the location of interest are given more weight than those farther away. Clustering of points is also taken into account, so that clusters of points are weighted less heavily (in effect, they contain less information than single points). This helps to reduce bias in the predictions.\nThe kriging predictor is an “optimal linear predictor” and an exact interpolator, meaning that each interpolated value is calculated to minimize the prediction error for that point. The value that is generated from the kriging process for any actually sampled location will be equal to the observed value at this point, and all the interpolated values will be the Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs).\nKriging will in general not be more effective than simpler methods of interpolation if there is little spatial autocorrelation among the sampled data points (that is, if the values do not co-vary in space). If there is at least moderate spatial autocorrelation, however, kriging can be a helpful method to preserve spatial variability that would be lost using a simpler method (for an example, see Auchincloss 2007, below).\nKriging can be understood as a two-step process:\n\nfirst, the spatial covariance structure of the sampled points is determined by fitting a variogram; and\nsecond, weights derived from this covariance structure are used to interpolate values for unsampled points or blocks across the spatial field.\n\nKriging methods require a variogram model. A variogram (sometimes called a “semivariogram”) is a visual depiction of the covariance exhibited between each pair of points in the sampled data. For each pair of points in the sampled data, the gamma-value or “semi-variance” (a measure of the half mean-squared difference between their values) is plotted against the distance, or “lag”, between them. The “experimental” variogram is the plot of observed values, while the “theoretical” or “model” variogram is the distributional model that best fits the data.\n\n\n\nWorking with gstat\nFirstly, we will calculate and examine the empirical variogram by using variogram() of gstat package. The function requires two arguments:\n\nformula, the dependent variable and the covariates (same as in gstat, see Section 12.2.1)\ndata, a point layer with the dependent variable and covariates as attributes\n\nas shown in the code chunk below.\n\nv &lt;- variogram(MONTHSUM ~ 1, \n               data = rfdata_sf)\nplot(v)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can then compare the plot with the theoretical models below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the comparison above, am empirical variogram model will be fitted by using fit.variogram() of gstat package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nfv &lt;- fit.variogram(object = v,\n                    model = vgm(\n                      psill = 0.5, \n                      model = \"Sph\",\n                      range = 5000, \n                      nugget = 0.1))\nfv\n\n  model     psill    range\n1   Nug 0.1129190    0.000\n2   Sph 0.5292397 5213.396\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSpatial interpolation is not a rocket science, students should try to explore the method by changing psill, model, range, nugget arguments in order to understand how the final surface map will be affected by different options used.\n\n\nWe can visualise how well the observed data fit the model by plotting fv using the code chunk below.\n\nplot(v, fv)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above reveals that the empirical model fits rather well. In view of this, we will go ahead to perform spatial interpolation by using the newly derived model as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nk &lt;- gstat(formula = MONTHSUM ~ 1, \n           data = rfdata_sf, \n           model = fv)\nk\n\ndata:\nvar1 : formula = MONTHSUM`~`1 ; data dim = 43 x 2\nvariograms:\n        model     psill    range\nvar1[1]   Nug 0.1129190    0.000\nvar1[2]   Sph 0.5292397 5213.396\n\n\nOnce we are happy with the results, predict() of gstat package will be used to estimate the unknown grids by using the code chunk below.\n\nresp &lt;- predict(k, coop)\n\n[using ordinary kriging]\n\nresp$x &lt;- st_coordinates(resp)[,1]\nresp$y &lt;- st_coordinates(resp)[,2]\nresp$pred &lt;- resp$var1.pred\nresp$pred &lt;- resp$pred\nresp\n\nSimple feature collection with 314019 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2692.528 ymin: 15773.73 xmax: 56371.45 ymax: 50231.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\nFirst 10 features:\n   var1.pred  var1.var                  geometry        x        y     pred\n1   131.0667 0.6608399 POINT (25883.42 50231.33) 25883.42 50231.33 131.0667\n2   130.9986 0.6610337  POINT (25933.4 50231.33) 25933.40 50231.33 130.9986\n3   130.9330 0.6612129 POINT (25983.38 50231.33) 25983.38 50231.33 130.9330\n4   130.8698 0.6613782 POINT (26033.36 50231.33) 26033.36 50231.33 130.8698\n5   130.8092 0.6615303 POINT (26083.34 50231.33) 26083.34 50231.33 130.8092\n6   130.7514 0.6616697 POINT (26133.32 50231.33) 26133.32 50231.33 130.7514\n7   130.6965 0.6617971  POINT (26183.3 50231.33) 26183.30 50231.33 130.6965\n8   130.6446 0.6619131 POINT (26233.28 50231.33) 26233.28 50231.33 130.6446\n9   130.5958 0.6620184 POINT (26283.26 50231.33) 26283.26 50231.33 130.5958\n10  132.5484 0.6542154 POINT (25033.76 50181.32) 25033.76 50181.32 132.5484\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nresp is a sf tibble data.frame with point features.\n\n\nIn order to create a raster surface data object, rasterize() of terra is used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nkpred &lt;- terra::rasterize(resp, grid, \n                         field = \"pred\")\nkpred\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 690, 1075, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 49.98037, 50.01103  (x, y)\nextent      : 2667.538, 56396.44, 15748.72, 50256.33  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : SVY21 / Singapore TM (EPSG:3414) \nsource(s)   : memory\nname        :      last \nmin value   :  72.77826 \nmax value   : 195.53284 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe output object kpred is in SpatRaster object class with a spatial resolution of 50m x 50m.

They didn’t just stop there – they also dug into students’ backgrounds, home situations, and school factors that could shake things up. PISA is like the gold standard when it comes to checking out how well students are really learning on a global scale. The results spill the beans on the quality and fairness of learning achievements worldwide, giving educators and policy folks the lowdown on what’s working in different countries.\nBut PISA isn’t just about the numbers; it’s about creating a common ground and getting people to team up and use that data. The whole idea is to get schools and policymakers to stop sizing themselves up against their own kind and start looking outwards. PISA wants them to peek at what teachers, schools, and policymakers are doing around the world and learn a thing or two.\nFast-forward to 2022, and PISA is still at it. They’ve got eight questionnaires floating around, getting the scoop from different education big shots – students, teachers, parents, and school principals. It’s like a global report card but with a whole lot more details."

In the earlier years, such as 1983, the distribution of daily mean temperature values was more widely spread out compared to recent years, particularly noticeable in 2003 and 2013. Moreover, the majority of the distribution exhibits a left-skewed pattern, with the exception of 2013, which demonstrates a right-skewed distribution.\nMaximum Daily Temperature: Over the period from 1983 to 2023, there has been a rise in the maximum daily temperature. The spread of maximum daily temperature values was broader in the earlier years, with 2023 showing the narrowest spread among the observed years. Furthermore, the distribution of maximum daily temperatures is consistently left-skewed across all years.\nMinimum Daily Temperature: Between 1983 and 2023, observations indicate that during 1993 and 2013, the daily mean temperature values were narrower in comparison to 1983, 2003, and 2023, which displayed a more extensive spread. Additionally, most of the distribution demonstrates a left-skewed pattern, with 1983 being the exception, exhibiting a distribution that is more or less normal."

Throughout the month, the trend line of the daily mean temperature appeared relatively stable, showing no notable increase or decrease.\n2003: In 2003, the maximum daily mean temperature for May occurred on day 24, reaching 30.6°C, while the lowest was recorded on day 10, measuring 27.4°C. Throughout the month, the trend line of the daily mean temperature appeared to be on the rise.\n2013: In 2013, the maximum daily mean temperature for May occurred on day 13, reaching 29.9°C, while the lowest was recorded on day 30, measuring 26.9°C.

This variation might indicate increased volatility or fluctuations in temperatures throughout the year 2003.\nFrom the trend line analysis, it’s evident that from 1983 to 1993, the daily mean temperature trend remained relatively stable, with no significant increase or decrease observed. However, between 1993 and 2003, there was a noticeable upward trend in the daily mean temperature. Subsequently, from 2003 to 2013, the trend line depicted a decrease in the daily mean temperature. However, from 2013 to 2023, there was a clear upward trend, culminating in the highest mean temperature observed among the past years.\nThe positioning of the box plot for 2023 at the highest level, along with 10 days of daily mean temperature exceeding the highest recorded daily mean temperature in 1983, and with the monthly mean temperature ranging from 28.3 °C in 1983 to 29.5 °C in 2023, strongly indicates a significant increase in temperature during 2023 compared to 1983."
